      "# Wire Federation Documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Wire Federation system, detailing its architecture, components, and the API interactions it facilitates between multiple backends. The documentation is structured in two distinct sections: one geared towards non-technical users, explaining the purpose and benefits of Wire Federation, and the other focused on technical users, providing in-depth information, code snippets, and practical guidance for implementation and troubleshooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-Technical User Section\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview of Wire Federation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wire Federation** allows separate Wire backend installations to communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling users on different backends to interact just as they would if they were on the same backend. This is particularly valuable for organizations that have multiple client installations or those that require an isolated on-premises deployment but still want to communicate with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Purpose and Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Enhanced Communication:** Wire Federation allows different teams and organizations to collaborate without the need for a single centralized system. Users from different installations can send messages, share files, and make calls just as if they were part of a single system.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Flexibility in Deployment:** Organizations can choose to deploy either in the cloud or on an on-prem backend based on their security and compliance needs, while still being able to interact with users on other installations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Controlled Interaction:** Administrators have the option to specifically list which backends can communicate with their server, providing an added layer of security and control over who interacts with whom.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Practical Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Interconnected Teams:** Your teams can work together across different installations, increasing productivity and collaboration.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** Organizations can maintain their independence while still allowing for necessary communication channels, which is critical for companies maintaining sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Configuration Options:** Administrators have multiple configurations at their disposal, allowing adaptability as business needs change.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** If Team A is deployed on a cloud-based Wire server and Team B is using an on-prem infrastructure, Wire Federation enables both teams to send messages and collaborate without the need for both to be on the same system.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical User Section\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Architecture of Wire Federation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wire Federation** consists of various components, primarily: **Federation Ingress** and **Federator**. Each backend includes these components to manage communications, ensuring secure and authorized exchanges between different systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Components\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Federation Ingress:** Acts as the entry point for incoming requests from other backends and ensures they are directed to the appropriate Federator component.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Federator:** Responsible for processing federated requests received from the Federation Ingress, performing necessary authorization checks, and facilitating outbound requests to other federated components.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Backend Domains\n",
      "\n",
      "Each Wire installation has two domains:\n",
      "- **Infrastructure Domain:** The network-accessible domain for the backend (e.g., `wire.infra.example.com`).\n",
      "- **Backend Domain:** The domain used for identifying users within that backend (e.g., `example.com`).\n",
      "\n",
      "This differentiation enables users from different backends to maintain unique identifiers while facilitating federated communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Communication Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Communication between backends involves mutual authentication and authorization, primarily facilitated through TLS. Key steps include:\n",
      "1. **Authentication:** Verify the identity of the connecting backend.\n",
      "2. **Discovery:** Determine the infrastructure domain associated with a backend domain.\n",
      "3. **Authorization:** Confirm that both backends permit federated communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Snippet Example\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a configuration for setting up an SRV record necessary for discovery:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# Set up SRV record for backend discovery\n",
      "_wire-server-federator._tcp.example.com. 600 IN SRV 0 10 443 federator.wire.example.org.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:** This SRV record allows other wire-server installations to discover your backend. The parameters include:\n",
      "- **Service and Protocol:** Defined as `wire-server-federator` and `tcp`.\n",
      "- **Port:** Typically set to `443` for secure communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Federation API Conventions\n",
      "\n",
      "All API calls related to federation should begin with the `/federation/` prefix. Each path should be structured in kebab-case format, facilitating clear and consistent interaction between federated components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of an API call to send a message across federated backends:\n",
      "\n",
      "```http\n",
      "POST /federation/send-message\n",
      "Content-Type: application/json\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"from\": \"user1@example.com\",\n",
      "  \"to\": \"user2@otherbackend.com\",\n",
      "  \"message\": \"Hello from federated backend!\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conflict Resolution & Caveats\n",
      "- Note that the **Federation development is currently a work in progress**. Features are being continually added and refined.\n",
      "- **Important:** Changing the backend domain after user interaction can cause undefined behavior, potentially leading to data loss or client crashes. It is critical to lock down your domain configurations after they are set.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Conflicts:**\n",
      "- Changing backend identifiers post-federation setup may lead to issues in user identification across systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Wire Federation represents a robust approach to cross-backend communications, facilitating better collaboration while prioritizing security and control. With active development, users should remain informed about updates to features and best practices of deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "This documentation serves as a reference for both non-technical stakeholders seeking to understand the benefits of Wire Federation and technical users implementing or managing the federation system. For further questions or clarifications, please refer to the appropriate sections or reach out with specific queries.\n"
