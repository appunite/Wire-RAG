# Summary

The documentation collectively outlines the framework and requirements for making requests between two federated backends using the Wire 0.0.4 API. Key points emphasize the roles of the *Federator* and *Federation Ingress* components in facilitating communication between backends, including authentication and authorization processes. The most recent updates highlight enhancements in processing federated requests, the ability to send requests to multiple backends in parallel, and the evolution of API conventions to improve functionality.

# Detailed Analysis

## Federated Requests Overview
- According to the **2023-01-10** document, every federated API request involves a service component (like brig or galley) in one backend, which communicates through the *Federator*. The response is relayed back via the *Federator Ingress* in the other backend.
  
## Backend to Backend Communication
- The document marked **None** specifies critical checks necessary for inter-backend communication:
  - **Authentication**: Determine the identity (infrastructure domain name) of the other backend.
  - **Discovery**: Ensure that the other backend is properly authorized.
  - **Authorization**: Confirm that each backend is approved to federate with each other.

## Federation Architecture
- In another **None** date document, the architecture is described: each backend consists of *Federation Ingress* and *Federator*, which are key to the backend's incoming and outgoing request management.

## Allow List Configuration
- According to the documents dated **2020-12-15**, federation is initially disabled, requiring specific backends to be added to an allow list for federated communication. They must also trust each other’s CA certificate for interactions to function correctly.

## API Changes and Enhancements
- The content released on **2024-07-09** notes recent changes allowing federated requests to multiple backends in parallel, enhancing conversation management by ensuring updates apply to remote users and confirming that the updated API conventions align with existing functionalities.

## Example Request Flow
The flow of requests between the federated components can include the following pseudocode:

```plaintext
SenderBackend → Federator → Federation Ingress → ReceiverBackend
```

## Prerequisites for Testing Federation
To verify that federation works, the following prerequisites are needed:
- Two configured backends with federation enabled.
- An allow list containing each other.
- Trust in each other's CA certificate.
- Creation of user accounts across both backends.

## Updated Functionalities
The latest updates include changes to request handling, namespace unification in conversation IDs, and new endpoints for remote connections.

# Contradictions

The listed documents did not have direct contradictions but provided varying levels of detail regarding the same aspects of federation. However, the general principles in the documentation clearly line up, and to ensure comprehensive coverage, I will present relevant alternatives without special mention of conflicts since they are reconcilable:

- **Authentication and Authorization Requirements**:
  - From the **2023-01-10** document, requests must be relayed via components while ensuring the appropriate authentication and authorization.
  - The document with **None** makes explicit mention of the need for both mutual authentication and authorization for determining backend identities.

Each document reinforces these requirements without conflicting information, implying consistent expectations for backend communication within federated systems.
